Some feedback:
- Is it possible if we hear this music our heartbeats are changing?
- Do we respond physically to music therapy?
- We have physiological data, sound, pod usage
- Now we have three different points of view
- Music therapy taking more of a role of self-expression, not self-attenuation
- This is another modality of expression
