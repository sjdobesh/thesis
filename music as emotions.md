- timbres focusing on r0 and r1 sound "pure" and are peaceful

X axis = modality

3–5-year olds give highly similar responses to adults when asked to match musical pieces to facial expressions reflective of basic emotions _(happy, sad, angry, fear and neutral_)

Happiness and sadness are easiest to percieve and this precedes other emotions.
3 year olds distinguish happy and sad music while 4-6 year olds can percieve and identify happiness, sadness, anger, and fear. Note children often confuse fear and anger and sometimes confuse angry and happy

Tempo is a universal marker of excitment/arousal. Major and minor distinction is particularly western european.

Dalla Bella et al. ([[https://web-p-ebscohost-com.ezproxy.library.wwu.edu/ehost/detail/detail?vid=0&sid=b6c87988-e548-49f1-9336-92e5f139a483%40redis&bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#bib7 "7" | 7]]) modified both tempo and mode of pre-existing classical music pieces, and reported that 3–4-year-olds failed to distinguish happy and sad expression, 5-year-olds' responses were affected by tempo change only, and 6–8-year-olds and adults were affected by both mode and tempo manipulations

Similarly, Gregory, Worrall, and Sarge ([16]) showed that 7–8 year-olds but not 3–4-year-olds were able to distinguish between sad and happy expression when only mode of the excerpts was modified

tempo and loudness in particular
Webster and Weir ([42]) showed that the typical positive association between tempo and happiness was inverted among minor, nonharmonised phrases
